<h1>Lichess</h1>
Some links related to statistics I gathered about everyone's favorite chess site, <a href='https://lichess.org'>lichess.org</a>. To contact me, visit <a href='https://lichess.org/@/thijscom'>my lichess profile</a>.

	<img src='favicon.ico'> <a href='/rankings/all/all/list_players_trophies.html'><b>Lichess Arena Rankings</b></a><br/>
	These rankings are based on approximately half a million regularly-scheduled lichess arenas, ranging from hourly bullet arenas to yearly king of the hill arenas and titled arenas. See who scored the most trophies, the highest scores, who played in most events, and more! These rankings get updated regularly via automated scripts. (The code used to generate all these rankings is available on <a href='https://github.com/tmmlaarhoven/lichess/'>GitHub</a>.)
</li>
<li>
	<img src='favicon.ico'> <a href='/rankings/index.html'><b>Lichess Arena Statistics</b></a><br/>
	Associated to the rankings webpage mentioned above, this page lists some plots and visualizations of overall statistics of all the arenas collected in these rankings. Compare average ratings between different format, draw rates between variants, and see which variants and tournaments saw the biggest participation over the years.
</li>
<li>
	<img src='favicon-ladder.ico'> <a href='/ladder/bullet'><b>Lichess Ladder</b></a><br/>
	A ladder of the top Lichess players, ranked according to lifetime scores against other top players. Whereas ratings are volatile, and can go down quickly on good/bad days, these rating estimates are more stable, and may reflect relative strengths of top players better. Unsurprisingly, several public alts of the World Champion are on the top of the rankings, as well as some anonymous accounts.

	<img src='youtube.png'> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z84Ctlkl9S8'><b>Lichess Leaderboard - Titled Arenas</b></a><br/>
	An animation of the total points scored over time for titled arenas. It shows the initial dominance of <a href='https://lichess.org/@/DrNykterstein'>Magnus Carlsen</a>, who regularly participated, and the rise of <a href='https://lichess.org/@/alireza2003'>Alireza Firouzja</a> and <a href='https://lichess.org/@/penguingim1'>Andrew Tang</a>. (Rankings based on data until September 2020.)

	<img src='youtube.png'> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXXCE3p6638'><b>Lichess Leaderboard - Seasonal Marathons</b></a><br/>
	Similar to the titled arenas, this shows which players scored the most points in seasonal marathons over time. People familiar with these marathons will not be surprised to see <a href='https://lichess.org/@/Lance5500'>Lance5500</a> on top of these rankings. (Rankings based on data until September 2020.)

<li>
	<img src='youtube.png'> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0F7TPFKxLg'><b>Lichess Leaderboard - Active Players</b></a><br/>
	Rather than based on points gathered in different events, this animation illustrates which players played the most (standard) games on Lichess over time. Featuring the legend <a href='https://lichess.org/@/german11'>german11</a>. (Rankings based on data until September 2020.)

	<img src='youtube.png'> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEVs_9lcm4g'><b>Lichess Timeline - Popular Time Controls</b></a><br/>
	This video shows how the favorite time controls on lichess evolved over time. As lichess introduced quick pairing pools (1+0, 3+0, 3+2, etc.), one can see a clear convergence to these time controls, and the initially popular 5+8 went out of fashion quickly. (Timeline based on data until September 2020.)
